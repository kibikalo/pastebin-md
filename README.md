# [Pastebin.md](https://kibikalo.github.io/pastebin-md/)

The current state of the project is that I have temporarily cut out the pastebin features and concentrated on the markdown editor itself, which you can try [here](https://kibikalo.github.io/pastebin-md/). 

It has **Synchronous Scrolling, Toolbar & Hot Keys, Code Highlighting, Dark/Light theme switcher**

In the future updates, I will return to implementing pastebin as well as a few other important features.

## Tech Stack
    - React.js
    - Tailwind CSS
        - Typography plugin
    - Marked.js
    - Highlight.js
