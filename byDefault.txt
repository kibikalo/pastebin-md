### Code Highlighting

For code highlighting, I'm using [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) library.
To set highlighted language, just write it's alias like this in code block syntax:
```
    ```js
    
    ```
```
To see supported languages and their aliases, search in this official [table](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md).

 ```js
useEffect(() => {
        const savedTheme = getCookie('theme');
        const isDarkMode = savedTheme === 'dark' ? true : window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
        setIsDark(isDarkMode);
    }, []);
 ```
